# ✅ FIXED: Continuous Update Prompts Issue

## Problem Solved ✅
The "New version available! Click OK to update." prompt was appearing continuously.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Service Worker Disabled in Development
- Service worker now only runs in production
- Development mode is clean and fast

### 2. PWA Plugin Disabled in Dev  
- No more automatic service worker regeneration
- Faster hot reload

### 3. Better Update Control
- Update prompts show only once
- Wait 5 minutes if user declines
- Check updates every hour (not every minute)

## Quick Fix Steps (Do This Now)

### Step 1: Clear Service Workers
**Open your browser console (F12) and run:**
```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()
  .then(regs => regs.forEach(reg => reg.unregister()));
location.reload();
```

### Step 2: That's It!
The code changes are already done. After clearing service workers and refreshing, the prompts will stop.

## Alternative: Manual Clear

1. Press **F12** (DevTools)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Service Workers** (left sidebar)
4. Click **Unregister** for all service workers
5. Click **Clear storage** (left sidebar)
6. Click **Clear site data**
7. Close DevTools
8. Refresh page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

## Verification

Run this in console to verify service workers are gone:
```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(regs => {
  console.log('Service workers:', regs.length);
  // Should show: 0 (in development)
});
```

## What Happens Now

### Development Mode (npm run dev)
- ✅ No service worker
- ✅ No update prompts
- ✅ Fast development
- ✅ Normal hot reload

### Production Mode (npm run build)
- ✅ Service worker enabled
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Smart update detection
- ✅ User-friendly prompts

## Files Modified
1. `src/hooks/use-service-worker.ts` - Added dev mode check
2. `vite.config.ts` - Disabled PWA in dev

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - No more continuous prompts!
