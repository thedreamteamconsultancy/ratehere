## 🐛 Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations:
1. Weekly/monthly leaderboards recalculate on page load
2. Reply depth is one level (no nested replies to replies)
3. No edit/delete for replies yet
4. No notification system for replies
5. Search is client-side (could be slow with many profiles)

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. **Cache** leaderboard data (reduce Firestore reads)
2. **Background Job** for leaderboard calculation
3. **Server-side Search** with Algolia/Elasticsearch
4. **Notifications** for reply mentions
5. **Edit/Delete** capabilities for replies
6. **Like System** for reviews and replies
7. **Profile Stats** showing weekly/monthly rank
8. **Achievement System** for milestones
9. **Points System** for gamification
10. **Trending Section** on homepage

---

## 💡 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Applied:
- Limited search results (6 on homepage)
- Lazy loading of replies (fetch on demand)
- Firestore query limits (top 3 reviews)
- Debounced search input
- Conditional rendering

### Monitoring Recommended:
- Firestore read/write counts
- Search query performance
- Leaderboard calculation time
- Page load times
- Bundle size (currently ~1.45MB)
